Hey at the time of download of this software it may preaty not be complete but i made it eaesier and i added d node and bower packages so u dont have to go
through additional installs d arduino part its quite easy to di jyst add d librarries (rfidmaster) its in the file with the schmatics u should create your oen db am sure if you know how to code reading my code wont be that hard.
And note u do not neccessary need to use my GUI the concept is still availble arduino to serial with node next to socketio and angular reads it and alert() the read json ,plus this is my firtst comit kinda horrible if u have a way of simplyfying this just create a pull request thanks.

And yeah to start it u just type "node mserver.js com12"
 or u could replace com12 with ur own port
